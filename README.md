The REST-API of the HouseholdOrganizer project.

The HouseholdOrganizer is a project for collaborative digital management and dissolution of a household. 

This Spring-based API replaces the old API written in PHP. You can find the archived repository [here](https://github.com/thlemm/HouseholdOrganizer-Legacy-API.)
The frontend for this API is the [HouseholdOrganizer-App](https://github.com/thlemm/HouseholdOrganizer-App)
